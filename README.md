BlockRight: A Modern Ad-Blocking Chrome Extension
A high-performance, modern ad-blocking extension built with React and Material-UI, leveraging the latest Chrome Manifest V3 APIs for a fast, reliable, and clean Browse experience.


About The Project
This project was developed to create a robust and user-friendly ad blocker from the ground up. It uses Chrome's powerful Declarative Net Request API for maximum performance, ensuring that ad-blocking happens natively without slowing down your browser. The user interface is a sleek, dark-themed popup built with React and Material-UI, providing statistics and per-site controls.

Features

Modern UI: A beautiful and responsive popup menu built with React and Material-UI, featuring a dark theme.

Per-Site Whitelisting: Easily disable ad-blocking on your favorite websites with a single toggle switch in the popup.

Live Stats: View the total number of ads blocked since installation.

Real-Time Badge Counter: The extension icon shows a live count of ads blocked on the current page.

Comprehensive Blocklist: Comes pre-loaded with an expanded list of common ad and tracker domains.
